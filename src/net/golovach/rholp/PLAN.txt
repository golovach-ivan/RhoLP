1. The Lexical Grammar
2. The Syntactic Grammar

A lexical grammar for the RhoLang programming language has as its terminal symbols the characters of the Unicode character set. It defines a set of productions, starting from the goal symbol Input (§3.5), that describe how sequences of Unicode characters (§3.1) are translated into a sequence of input elements (§3.5).
These input elements, with white space (§3.6) and comments (§3.7) discarded, form the terminal symbols for the syntactic grammar for the Java programming language and are called tokens (§3.5). These tokens are the identifiers (§3.8), keywords (§3.9), literals (§3.10), separators (§3.11), and operators (§3.12) of the RhoLang programming language.

The syntactic grammar has tokens defined by the lexical grammar as its terminal symbols.
It defines a set of productions, starting from the goal symbol CompilationUnit (§7.3),
that describe how sequences of tokens can form syntactically correct programs.
